# 2048 Game

A simple implementation of the classic **2048** puzzle game.

Slide the tiles, combine matching numbers, and try to reach **2048**.  
Sounds easy. It’s not.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **arrow keys** (or swipe, if supported) to move tiles.
- When two tiles with the **same number** touch, they merge.
- Each move spawns a new tile (usually 2, sometimes 4).
- The game ends when:
  - You reach **2048** (you win 🎉)
  - There are no valid moves left (game over)
